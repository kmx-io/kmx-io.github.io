title: Convert your website to Erlang / Elixir / Phoenix
---

## 1 Erlang, Elixir, Phoenix, PostgreSQL

We can rewrite your website in Elixir and Phoenix.

Elixir is a new language on top of the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM)
which provides scalability (> 10k simultaneous users) to your website.

For comparison a Ruby on Rails website might support a few hundred
simultaneous users.

## 2 Webpack, Javascript 6

We can adapt the front of your website to use Webpack and ECMA script 6.

Webpack and Javascript 6 using Babel are the latest development for
website assets management. Generate your CSS and Javascript files using
the latest versions of every package.

## 3 Maintenance

We can provide maintenance for your Elixir application.

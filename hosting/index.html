    <h2>Hosting</h2>
    <p>
    </p>
    
    <h3>1 UNIX dedicated servers</h3>
    <p>
      Hosting is primarily done on dedicated servers because they
      provide better security, but all that can be done on a dedicated
      server can also be done on a VPS.
    </p>

    <h4>1.1 <a href="OpenBSD">OpenBSD</a></h4>
    <p>
      We support hosting of custom OpenBSD installations for slower but
      much more robust services.
    </p>

    <h4>1.2 <a href="Debian">Debian GNU/Linux</a></h4>
    <p>
      A very easy system to deploy and administrate and without too many
      flaws, Debian is a pleasure to work with.
    </p>

    <h3>2. UNIX services</h3>
    <p>
      We focus on event driven asychronous servers for they provide
      better performances of network applications.
    </p>
    
    <h4>2.1 Nginx</h4>
    <p>
      Fast and secure HTTP web server providing epoll and kqueue
      backends, Nginx completely beats Apache in every benchmark.
    </p>

    <h4>2.2 Qmail</h4>
    <p>
      A very good read because it really shows the UNIX principles,
      Qmail is a lightweight and performant electronic mail server
      with excellent security.
    </p>

    <h4>2.3 Dovecot</h4>
    <p>
      IMAP server for electronic mail consultation.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Web applications</h3>
    <p>
    </p>
    
    <h4>3.1 PHP</h4>
    <p>
      However criticized for security flaws, we believe PHP is still an
      option when designing web sites and support hosting PHP projects
      with specific needs.
    </p>

    <h4>3.2 Ruby on Rails</h4>
    <p>
      Ruby is a very nice and expressive programming language with
      a very short syntax for blocks which are wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruby on Rails is a web framework for Ruby which really helps
      programmers work together by defining a set of common rules,
      following DRY and convention over configuration principles.
    </p>

    <h4>3.3 Common Lisp</h4>
    <p>
      Hosting of Common Lisp programs for web programming.

title: Secure and reliable web hosting solutions
---

## 1 Our stack

### 1.1 Hardware : dedicated servers

We provide colocation on dedicated servers for every solution.
We get better performances and less complexity on real hardware compared
to virtual machines. Less complexity means less bugs and exploits.

### 1.2 Operating system : OpenBSD

The best operating system we found for a secure website is
[OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org).
It is simple, follows UNIX principles and is more secure than other
operating systems out of the box.

OpenBSD provides OpenSSH, OpenNTPd, unbound, pf, and a very strong
network stack.

### 1.3 HTTP server : Nginx

The best HTTP server we found is
[nginx](https://nginx.org).
It is robust and minimalistic like the rest of the system.

### 1.4 Application layer

We support Ruby, Elixir, PHP, Common Lisp and C/C++ hosting.
We can provide security audits and feature development for
these languages too.


## 2 Pricing

Pricing starts at 200â‚¬ per month.


## 3 Process
